I do not own most of the content used in this project like: 
* Music 
* Images 
* Public code used. 

I do not earn money from this and the only purpose of it was to complete the corresponding course.

## History of the game
The point of the game is to avoid a meteor shower for the longer time possible. It was meant to have some backstory but due to the short time I had for this project, it was never added. There was suppose to be a multiplayer mode, that was never fully implemented and stayed as future update idea.

## How to play
It´s pretty simple, you just need a mouse and keyboard (Only used to write down your username). There are some powerups that help you through the game, lives and a points counter.

## Powerups
There are powerups that increases lives, increases points or reduces hits. Which powerups do this? Well it´s up to you to figure it out. 

## Compatibility 
This game was developed to run in Chrome navigator, it may run in other navigators such as Firefox or Edge, but it´s not recommend it.

## Credit
You have all rights to use it as you wish, but I will be so grateful if you credit me for my hard work. Have fun!
